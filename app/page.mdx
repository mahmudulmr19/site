# Mahmudul Hasan

I’m a software developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I currently work at
[Rabfy](https://rabfy.com), building a print-on-demand platform for entrepreneurs. I’ve been coding since 2022.

I care about building software that works, keeping systems simple, and understanding how things behave in production.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time listening to music, staying indoors, and exploring new ideas to build.

You can find my work and experiments on
